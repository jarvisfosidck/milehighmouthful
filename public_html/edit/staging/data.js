{"postTitle":"Root Down","postDisplayDate":"Feb. 19, 2016","postSubTitle":"Trendy Neighborhood Spot that Suffers from the Hype","paragraphSingleArea":"<p>Root Down is a thing in Denver.  After five years of thinking about it, then dismissing it for either a more Capitol Hill accessible or budget friendly date night option, the husband and I finally found ourselves braving the LoHi hordes to see what the deal was with Root Down.<\/p><p>The crowd at Root Down is eclectic in the way that crowds at places like Root Down are eclectic: it boasted a wide array of different kinds of slightly hip (but not too hip) financially stable looking white people.  The vibe is comfortably trendy, with some of the industrial chic touches one sees everywhere, paired with some nods to old Hollywood (photos and TCM projected on a wall) that add a bit of a different twist.  To the credit of the host staff, we were promptly greeted and sorted out from a separate, very large group that entered with us, and we were happily directed to the bar area.  (I will note that I appreciate a staff that happily point people towards the bar if they don\u2019t have a reservation rather than the \u201cbetter luck next time\u201d thousand yard stare I\u2019ve gotten at other places.)<\/p><p>So, lady, how was the damn food already?  Husband and I elected to share two of the share (duh) plates, as well as a dessert.  We ordered horseradish gnocchi, diver sea scallops and the honeycomb and cheese dessert.  The gnocchi had a beautiful texture, hearty and satisfying without being heavy or gummy at all, and I appreciated the amount of sear of them to give them just the right amount of snap on the outside when I bit in.  Husband and I cleaned our plate, but we did note that some of the (many) components did not add a lot to the dish as a whole.  This issue would reoccur, to a much greater extent, when we moved on to the scallops.  Seared scallops are a good thing.  Seared scallops are also a kind of quintessential restaurant dish in that they are something that really can\u2019t be made at home.  I have no complaints with how Root Down sears its scallops, they had lovely caramelization on the outside, while retaining a delightful creaminess within.  The rest of dish, however, seemed a bit jumbled.  To quote the Root Down menu, the Diver Scallops are served with Plantain Hash, Brussel Sprouts, Butternut Squash, Edamame, Fried Capers, Pickled Red Onions and Lemon Habanero Tartar Sauce.  That\u2019s a lot of stuff.  I will say that the scallops, tartar sauce, and fried capers together constituted a lovely bite.  I will also say that the pickled red onions, which were placed on a bed of micro greens, made for a refreshing salad.  I do not think that my lovely scallop bite and the refreshing salad had much to do with each other.  The remainder of the ingredients were, I\u2019m assuming, to be found in the very sweet sticky mound of stuff also on the plate, which Husband and I neither enjoyed with the scallops or on its own.  The plate, in short, seriously lacked harmony.   Finally, the honeycomb and cheese dessert, was, you know, a cheese course, and a fairly harmonious, if not particularly inspired one.  The honeycomb was, it should be noted, phenomenal, and I wanted more than the small portion that I received, and it played very well with the mild blue cheese and apples it was paired with. <\/p><p>Long story short, would we go back? Shrug.  The food was pretty good, the atmosphere was fun.  I would be interested in investigating their brunch, and can see myself checking out what the dining room experience would be like, but, as a whole, there are lots of places closer to home that I\u2019ve had better food at the same, if not slightly less, price.  For my part, I\u2019m glad I finally checked out the Root Down phenomenon, but I won\u2019t be rushing back.<\/p>","heartsSelected":"<i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart-o\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart-o\"><\/i>","emojiMouthfulBlurgs":"<p class=\"bottomMouthfulIcons\"><i class=\"fa fa-dollar\"><\/i> A little pricier than comparable restaurants<\/p>","resturantWebsite":"http:\/www.rootdowndenver.com\/","resturantNeighborHood":"LoHi","docURLs":["data\/images\/rootdown.jpg","data\/images\/rootdown2.jpg","data\/images\/rootdown3.jpg"]}

,{"postTitle":"Pinche Taqueria aka Tacos Tequila Whiskey","postDisplayDate":"Feb. 29, 2016","postSubTitle":"Happy Hour Makes It Even Better","paragraphSingleArea":"<p>Although the sign may say something different, the establishment that I choose to keep calling Pinche Taqueria remains a consistent neighborhood joint that does only a couple of things, but does them very well.<\/p><p>Pinche does street tacos, an assortment of pseudo Mexican appetizers, and nice cocktail menu, and those street tacos are, of course, the raison d\u2019etre.  And oh, those tacos.  Over the course of a few visits, the Husband and I have enjoyed a variety of the nicely varied taco menu, and the quality of the offerings is pretty uniformly high.  The carnitas are tender and perfectly accompanied by pickled red onions, and the Husband devoured his shrimp and scallop taco as well.  A fried chicken taco recalls chicken and waffles in an unexpected and scrumptious way, although the chimichurri on that particular dish did not offer much in the way of additional flavor.  The only flaws encountered were relatively minor: some unexpectedly aggressive spicy notes in the Barbacoa shredded beef taco and pork belly tacos that were a little greasy and very hard to eat.  On the whole, Pinche\u2019s street tacos deliver time and again on the promise of highly flavorful Mexican street flavors.<\/p><p>The vibe at Pinche never ceases to amaze me, as the places seems almost universally busy.  Service, however, seems to manage the chaos very well, as for all of the bodies packed into the small Colfax & York location, servers and hosts always seem to have a firm handle on everything\u2019s that going on in their restaurant.  Despite an inevitable wait, people are seated as promptly as possible, and the staff seems to have a firm grasp of where every table is at in the progression of their meal.  Pinche can be a bit of a odd duck, the prices are not low, and the ambiance can suggest a trendy downtown vibe, but a multi course meal can fly by in a little as forty-five minutes, even with an extra round of Pinche\u2019s excellent cocktails.  A romantic date night spot it is not, but Pinche serves up what much of Denver is craving: flavorful bites, fresh ideas and minimal fuss.  <\/p>","heartsSelected":"<i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart-o\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart-o\"><\/i>","emojiMouthfulBlurgs":"<p class=\"bottomMouthfulIcons\"><i class=\"fa fa-check-square-o\"><\/i> Always worth a try<\/p>","resturantWebsite":"http:\/\/tacostequilawhiskey.com\/","resturantNeighborHood":"City Park","docURLs":["data\/images\/pinchetacos3.jpg","data\/images\/pinchetacos2.jpg","data\/images\/pinchetacos1.jpg"]}




,{"postTitle":"Potager","postDisplayDate":"Mar. 5, 2016","postSubTitle":"A Longtime Favorite Continues to Deliver","paragraphSingleArea":"<p>As we used to live very nearby, the Husband and I used to end up at Potager probably more often than was strictly healthy for our bank account.  It was, however, a uniquely tempting destination: one of the best exemplars I\u2019ve encountered of the combination of upscale dining with the Denver casual hangout vibe.  There\u2019s no doubt that Potager is an upscale dining experience, the prices are not low, the wine list is thoughtful, the food refined, and the tables covered in white cloth.  The general ambiance at Potager though, still seems to exude casual warmth.  Potager is, in a word, hospitable.  <\/p><p>A recent trip back to Potager reminded Husband and I of why we had ended up there so often.  We began with two selections from the \u201csmall plate\u201d offerings that take up the top half of Potager\u2019s menu.  Both were excellent.  If you go to Potager and they\u2019re offering a cheese souffl\u00e9, order it.  Our gruyere souffl\u00e9 was decadently creamy and light and served on a rich beef broth with caramelized onions, making it the the  most elevated rendition of a French onion soup that one could hope for.  In the past, a blue cheese souffl\u00e9 was equally well done.  The orange and date salad was deceptively complex.  The acid from the citrus provided a much needed counterbalance to the sweetness of the dates, pistachios and radish sprouts added crunch and another layer of fresh flavor.  My entr\u00e9e featured pan seared scallops served with fingerling potatoes and a carrot sauce, which while still very tasty was not as successful as the rest of the food we enjoyed that evening.  The scallops were slightly over cooked, likely as a result of their small size, and while the sauce was flavorful and complex, the potatoes did not add much to the dish.  The Husband\u2019s entr\u00e9e, wood fired chicken, conversely, was another knockout.  The bird was deliciously moist and rich with herbal notes of sage, yet nicely balanced by the preserved lemon salsa.  The portion was large, and yet the bird was picked clean by the time we (reluctantly) let them clear our plates, a truly perfect dish.<\/p><p>Service at Potager is almost always excellent.  The staff is often knowledgable and gracious.  Service during our last visit was a bit slow, with some unfortunate gaps between courses, but we\u2019ve visited the restaurant enough to know that that is not the norm.  Potager does not take reservations, so be prepared for a wait if you visit during peak hours, but the dining room is large and the host staff adept at managing the wait.  Finally, during the coming spring and summer seasons, the back garden at Potager is beautiful place for an outdoor meal.   Potager has been doing the farm to table thing in Denver for a long time, and, in this case, practice has certainly made just about perfect.<\/p>","heartsSelected":"<i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart-o\"><\/i>","emojiMouthfulBlurgs":"\n\n\n","resturantWebsite":"http:\/\/www.potagerrestaurant.com","resturantNeighborHood":"Capitol Hill","docURLs":["data\/images\/potager3.jpg","data\/images\/potager2.jpg","data\/images\/potager1.jpg"]}










,{"postTitle":"To The Wind Bistro","postDisplayDate":"Mar. 18, 2016","postSubTitle":"High End Dining Without the Frills","paragraphSingleArea":"<p>To the Wind Bistro dispatches with most of the niceties of fine dining with the exception of the food itself.  It is, in The Husband\u2019s words, punk rock, with bare bones ambiance, day-of wait list and plenty of apparent friends and family of the proprietors swinging by throughout the evening.  To the Wind is also, without a doubt, a very good restaurant.  <\/p><p>To the Wind doesn\u2019t take reservations, but they do allow people to call ahead to add their names to the nightly wait list for dinner at the tiny restaurant, which can be a bit cumbersome for a guest trying to gauge their evening, but the staff proved themselves to be friendly and accommodating in helping us negotiate the process. The result of all of this was one failed attempt at date night, followed by a date night a week later that felt a bit more stressful than necessary, but ultimately satisfying once we were safely ensconced at our table.<\/p><p>This all to say, To the Wind Bistro is all about the food, which is often very good.  The bone marrow we enjoyed on our initial visit several months ago was a decadent way to start a meal, perfectly accented with pickled vegetables.  The foie gras torchon we kicked off our latest visit with was less memorable, a generously portioned serving of foie gras served without the additional components, flavors or textures necessary to elevate the dish.  Our green salad was both over dressed and overly acidic.  With the entrees, however, our visit turned around significantly, as both were excellent.  The Husband\u2019s turbot with corned veal evoked a Rueben in a whimsical and intensely satisfying manner, showing a sense of humor without sacrificing refinement or flavor.  My buttermilk chicken was fantastically tender and perfectly balanced by a sauce with delicate hints of citrus and an extremely flavorful parmesan gratin.  Both dishes were confident, refined and delicious.  <\/p><p>To the Wind is a unique establishment, it seems to be a particularly personal expression of its proprietors\u2019 passions and perspective, and its singular vision is a welcome addition to the Denver scene. <\/p>","heartsSelected":"<i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart-o\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart-o\"><\/i>","emojiMouthfulBlurgs":"<p class=\"bottomMouthfulIcons\"><i class=\"fa fa-venus-mars\"><\/i> Date night spot<\/p>","resturantWebsite":"http:\/\/tothewindbistro.com\/","resturantNeighborHood":"City Park \/ East Colfax","docURLs":["data\/images\/tothewind1.jpg","data\/images\/tothewind3.jpg","data\/images\/tothewind2.jpg"]}

The food theme is smoked meats, like those guys who pull trailers and go to BBQ fairs and talk about BBQ sauce.  But don't just order any of the meat that isn't in other food.  I ordered a sampler of all the smoked meats and that was good, but I was better off going to a BBQ fair.  The wife ordered some amazing pasta dish with rabbit that she said tasted like Spring in a Bowl, and we took home the leftovers and fought about who got to eat them.  Some very talented people know how to work regular smoked meat into common dishes that are part of an elevated dining experience.<\/p>","heartsSelected":"<i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i><i class=\"fa fa-heart\"><\/i>","emojiMouthfulBlurgs":"\n\n","resturantWebsite":"http:\/\/oldmajordenver.com\/","resturantNeighborHood":"LoHi","docURLs":["data\/images\/oldmajor2.jpg","data\/images\/oldmajor3.jpg","data\/images\/oldmajor4.jpg"]}
